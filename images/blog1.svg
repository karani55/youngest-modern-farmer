        <p class="text">If I had an acre of good, well-drained land, I would keep a cow and a goat, a few pigs, and maybe a dozen hens. The goat would provide milk when the cow was dry; I might keep two or more goats. I would keep a Jersey cow to provide milk for myself and the pigs, but more importantly I would keep her for heaps and heaps of lovely manure. To derive any sort of living from that one acre without heavily relying on artificial fertilizer, the land would have to be heavily manured.</p>
