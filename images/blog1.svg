<text x="20" y="120" font-size="16" font-family="Open Sans, Arial" fill="#2e7d32"> myself, if i had an acre of good well drained land think i would keep a cow and a goat, a few piags and may be a dozen of hensThe goat would provide me with milk when the cow was dry. I might keep two or more goats in fact.-1 would have the cow (a Jersey) to provide me and the pigs with milk, but more important I would keep her to provide me with heaps and heaps of lovely manure. For if I was to derive any sort of living from that one acre, without the application of a lot of artificial fertilizer, it would have to be heavily manured.</text>
