I would keep a cow and a goat, a few pigs and maybe a
dozen hens. The goat would provide me with milk when
the cow was dry. I might keep two or more goats in fact.-1
would have the cow (a Jersey) to provide me and the pigs
with milk, but more important I would keep her to provide
me with heaps and heaps of lovely manure. For if I was to
derive any sort of living from that one acre, without the
application of a lot of artificial fertilizer, it would have to be
heavily manured.
Now the acre would only just support the cow and do
nothing else, so I would, quite shamelessly buy in most of
my food for the cow from outside. I would buy all my hay,
plenty of straw (unless I could cut bracken on a nearby
common), all my barley meal and some wheat meal, and
maybe some high protein in the form of bean meal or fish
meal (although I would aim to grow beans).
